http-code
=================

`http-code` is a small project to help get the definitions of each http response status code

To use, simply call `http-code.glitch.me/code`, where code is the 3-digit error code.
It will return json which will have the parameters
- code: the input error code
- def: the code definition
- exists: will always be true unless the code doesn't exist
